  "body": "### About\r\nLINKKI is a simplified kinetic toy designed by [Eun Young Park](http://eunyoungpark.co/). Notwithstanding its simplicity, its use is being proven quite versatile as a STEM learning tool, designer's prototyping tool, and artistic medium. However, the advantage of LINKKI, among others, lies in its adaptability and hackability. With basic Fab tools and affordable materials, parts can be easily fabricated. Moreover, it is [easily combined with existing toys such as Lego](https://github.com/yoric9/linkki/blob/master/LINKKIwithLego.JPG?raw=true). Through [workshops](https://vimeo.com/137459157) and [Maker Faire](http://tinkering.exploratorium.edu/2016/05/26/bay-area-maker-faire-2016)'s, I got to notice the need of affordable kits for motion design. But most of all, when it comes to the experience with LINKKI, the more widely it is shared, the more inspiring it gets. That's why I share the resources. Please enjoy and share your experience with [#linkkigram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/linkkigram/) on instagram!\r\n\r\n![cardboard linkki](https://github.com/yoric9/linkki/blob/master/cardboardLINKKI_dog.JPG?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Material \r\n- Board \r\n- Bars and circles\r\n- Active modules\r\n- Accessories (Fasteners and magnets)\r\n\r\n### Sharing\r\nThe sharing platform for LINKKI builds is shaping.
