  "body": "### About\r\nLINKKI is a simplified kinetic toy for learners and designers designed by [Eun Young Park](http://eunyoungpark.co/). Notwithstanding its simplicity, its use is quite versatile as a STEM educational tool, designer's kinetic prototyping tool, and artistic medium. But the advantage of LINKKI, among others, especially lies in its adaptability and hackability. With the files provided and basic Fab tools such as laster cutter, parts are easily fabricated with affordable material. \r\n\r\nThrough [workshops](https://vimeo.com/137459157) and [Maker Faire](http://tinkering.exploratorium.edu/2016/05/26/bay-area-maker-faire-2016)'s, the need of affordable teaching kits for motion design was recognized. And when it comes to the experience with LINKKI, the more widely it is shared, the more inspiring it gets. That's why I share the resources. Please enjoy and share your experience!\r\n\r\n![cardboard linkki](https://github.com/yoric9/linkki/blob/master/cardboardLINKKI_dog.JPG)\r\n\r\n### Material \r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Sharing\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
