### About
[LINKKI](https://vimeo.com/142410721) is a linkage-base kinetic toy designed by [Eun Young Park](http://eunyoungpark.co/). Notwithstanding its simplicity, its use is being proven quite versatile as a STEM learning tool, designer's prototyping tool, and artistic medium. But most of all, the advantage of LINKKI, among others, lies in its adaptability and hackability. Parts can be easily fabricated with basic Fab tools and affordable materials and it is [easily combined with existing toys such as Lego](https://github.com/yoric9/linkki/blob/master/LINKKIwithLego.JPG?raw=true). 

Through [workshops](https://vimeo.com/137459157) and [Maker Faire](http://bit.ly/22ycs9l)'s, I recognized the need of affordable kits for motion design. But above of all, when it comes to the experience with LINKKI, the more widely it is shared, the more inspiring it gets. That's why I share the resources.
